Now working:
- SSH client (to make it work, you'll need to run `mknod /dev/tty c 5 0`)
- ffmpeg (no more "Unknown encoder: 'copy'")
- Server sockets, like now you can run python3 -m http.server and browse your files from another device
- tar (sorry I broke it)
- lynx (this was working in the last build too but I only just realized)
- Ruby REPL (large programs will assert in the garbage collector though)

Also a bunch of general fixes:
- Signals not being blocked while the signal handler is running
- Orphaned processes not being reparented to init
- Git doing strange things when it gets a signal
- Copy button on iOS not existing
- Segfault when trying to run a binary that requires glibc
